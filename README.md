This code sets up the Pygame window, loads the necessary images, and defines classes for the skeleton family, dead pigs, and blood splatters. It then creates instances of these classes and randomly positions them on the screen. The animation loop continuously draws the images on the window and updates the display at a rate of 60 frames per second.
