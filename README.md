# SkeletonFamily

side note for later: provide the background image (background.jpg), skeleton image (skeleton.png), blood image (blood.png), and pig image (pig.png). Make sure to have these image files in the same directory as the Python script.

This code sets up the Pygame window, loads the necessary images, and defines classes for the skeleton family, dead pigs, and blood splatters. It then creates instances of these classes and randomly positions them on the screen. The animation loop continuously draws the images on the window and updates the display at a rate of 60 frames per second.

Please note that the images used in this example should be prepared in advance, and the content described may not be suitable for all audiences.
